<p>Welcome to the <strong>Calculus</strong> unit. In this unit we shall be studying the concepts of <em>limiting values of functions</em> and the <em>derivative </em>and <em>integral </em>of functions of a single variable. We shall also look at the concepts of <em>sequences</em> and <em>series </em>of real numbers. </p>
<p>In this unit you shall see an increased level of mathematical rigour compared to your pre-university studies. We shall be concerned with <em>proving </em>the various properties of convergence, differentiation and integration that we use.</p>
<p>The main resource we shall use for this unit is a selection of relevant chapters from the excellent free open-source textbook <em><a href="https://killianobrien.github.io/apex/output/html/apex-calculus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">APEX Calculus</a> </em>by <span style="font-size: 0.9375rem;">Gregory Hartman, Sean Fitzpatrick (Editor), Alex Jordan (Editor), Carly Vollet (Editor). This book has a wealth of explanations, examples and exercises to help you learn about these topics. It doesn't have as many proofs as we need -- so we shall supply any necessary extra proofs in the lectures. The book contains topics that go beyond our Calculus unit so don't be daunted by the size of it. But you should find these extra chapters interesting reading also. A link to the HTML version of this book is given below. This version will work really well on any size of device.</span></p>
<p>The <strong>Assessment </strong>for this unit consists of an end of unit exam which will take place during the Assessment period at the end of the Semester (see the schedule below). More information and plenty of support for your preparation for the exam shall be provided in due course. </p>
<p>Links to reading guidance, tutorial information, lecture captures and other resources shall be posted in the schedule table below as we go through the unit. </p>
