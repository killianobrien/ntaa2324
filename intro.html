<p>Welcome to the <strong>Number Theory and Abstract Algebra</strong> (NTAA) unit. In this unit we shall be learning about the very interesting areas of pure mathematics concerning 
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Number Theory</strong>: the integers, prime numbers and related properties,</li>
        <li><strong>Abstract Algebra</strong>: the many examples of groups in mathematics and some of the rich amount of theory that describes their structure.</li>
    </ul></p>

<p>
    The unit is taught with a combination of two 2-hour lectures and a 2-hour tutorial every week. The main resources are a set of lecture notes for Number Theory and a selection of chapters from an Abstract Algebra textbook. 
</p>


<p>The <strong>Assessment </strong>for this unit consists of
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>1CWK40</strong>: A set of <strong>coursework problems</strong>, released near the start of the unit, that you work on throughout the unit and submit in the Assessment period. See the Assessment block on Moodle for the submission date and time. These coursework problems contribute 40% to your unit mark. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>2EXAM60</strong>: A 3 hour written closed-book <strong>exam</strong>. This takes place in the Assessment period. See your exam timetable or the Assessment block on Moodle for the precise date, time and location.
        </li>
    </ul>
More information and plenty of support for your preparation for the coursework will be provided in the lectures and tutorials and here on Moodle. Similarly, plenty of support for the exam will be given in due course, including past/mock exams.</p>



<p>Links to reading guidance, tutorial information, lecture captures and other resources shall be posted in the schedule table below as we go through the unit.</p>
