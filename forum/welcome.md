## Welcome to the unit. 

Hello and welcome back to Semester 2 at Man Met. This email is to welcome you and get you rolling on the Number Theory and Abstract Algebra (NTAA) unit. 

The unit will start in earnest at the lecture on Wednesday morning at 9am in JD E223, followed by another lecture and tutorial on Thursday. All these sessions are two hours long. Please check your timetables for details and any updates. 

In the meantime I would ask you to go to the unit's [Moodle page](https://moodle.mmu.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=172088) and survey the content there. 

Some activities for you to do in advance of Wednesday:

* On Moodle, click through to the Number Theory [lecture notes](https://killianobrien.github.io/ntaa2324/NumberTheory.pdf) and Abstract Algebra [textbook](https://killianobrien.github.io/aata/output/html/aata.html) to get a feel for these resources. Note that we are only using a small subset of the chapters from the textbook. See Moodle for details. 
* Look over the schedule table on Moodle for an indication of what topics we'll be covering and when. 
* Check your emails for the sign-up invitation to [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/), an online service for using the Sagemath mathematical software system. We'll be making occasional use of this through in the unit.
    - If you don't already have a CoCalc account then follow the directions in the invite email, or go to, [cocalc.com/auth/sign-up](https://cocalc.com/auth/sign-up) and create an account using the `firstname.surname` form of your university email address. 
    - For an introduction to what the CoCalc system offers, read the introductory material on [What is CoCalc](https://doc.cocalc.com/index.html)
    - When signing up at CoCalc you can ignore any messages about payments and license fees for now and just proceed with the free account. 
    - On Moodle you will find a link to a free version of *Sage for Undergraduates*, by Gregory Bard. This is a useful resource if you want to find out more about Sage now. 

You will find my contact details near the top of the Moodle page. Click the relevant button to message me on Teams or email me. 

Looking forward to seeing you all on Wednesday morning!

Best regards, 

Killian O'Brien<br>
*Senior Lecturer in Mathematics*
